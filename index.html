      <h1>This is a printing office</h1>
      <p>
      Crossroads of civilization<br>
      Refuge of all the arts<br>

      Armory of the fearless truth<br>
      Against whispering rumor<br>
      Incessant trumpet of trade<br>

      Not to perish on waves of sound<br>
      Not to vary with the writer's hand<br>
      But fixed in time having been verified in proof<br>
