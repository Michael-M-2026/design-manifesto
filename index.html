    <h1>This is a printing office</h1>
    <p>
      Crossroads of civilization<br>
      Refuge of all the arts<br>
      Against the ravages of time<br>
      Armory of the fearless truth<br>
      Against whispering rumor<br>
      Incessant trumpet of trade<br>

      From this place words may fly abroad<br>
      Not to perish on waves of sound<br>
      Not to vary with the writer's hand<br>
      But fixed in time having been verified in proof<br>

      Friend you stand on the sacred ground:<br>
      This is a Printing Office
